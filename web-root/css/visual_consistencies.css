*  the font sizes and spacing together for a consistent look across all
*  browsers. 
*
*  There are other rules included in this stylesheet (with comments on each)
*  to handle other visual consistency issues. You do not need to use this
*  stylesheet, nor do you need to follow it exactly. You can make changes
*  anywhere you want to make things look the way you want to. Nothing here
*  _should_ break a layout if modified.
